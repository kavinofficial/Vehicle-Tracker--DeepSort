The Vehicle Tracker is a machine learning-based solution that combines real-time vehicle detection and tracking capabilities. It is specifically tailored for Indian road conditions and vehicle types, ensuring precise monitoring of vehicles in dynamic and diverse traffic environments.

The system uses advanced computer vision techniques to detect vehicles and track their movement continuously. By leveraging robust detection algorithms like YOLO and tracking mechanisms such as DeepSORT, the tracker maintains accuracy even in complex scenarios like dense traffic, occlusions, or varying speeds.

Optimized for real-time applications, the solution is suitable for traffic management, security surveillance, and urban planning.
